# BMI 706 Project - NHANES Drug & Alcohol Explorer
**Group: Vizionaries (Grace Liu, Taiyang Chen, Yantong Cui)** 

NHANES Drug & Alcohol Explorer is a data visualization tool developed for public health experts and also the general public to explore the factors and effects of substance usage including alcohol, marijuana/hashish, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and injection of illegal drugs in the United States. In this visualzation tool, we imported NHANES demograhic, questionnaire, and mortality data from 1999 to 2018 and visualized the temporal and demographic patterns of alcohol/drug usage and also linked alcohol/drug usage with mortality and certain health risks.
